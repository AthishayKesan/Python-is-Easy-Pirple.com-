Lyrics
 They say oh my god I see the way you shine
 Take your hand, my dear, and place them both in mine
 You know you stopped me dead while I was passing by
 And now I beg to see you dance just one more time
 Ooh I see you, see you, see you every time
 And oh my I, I, I like your style
 You, you make me, make me, make me wanna cry
 And now I beg to see you dance just one more time
 So they say
 Dance for me, dance for me, dance for me, oh, oh, oh
 I've never seen anybody do the things you do before
 They say move for me, move for me, move for me, ay, ay, ay
 And when you're done I'll make you do it all again
 I said oh my god I see you walking by
 Take my hands, my dear, and look me in my eyes
 Just like a monkey I've been dancing my whole life
 But you just beg to see me dance just one more time
 Ooh I see you, see you, see you every time
 And oh my I, I like your style
 You, you make me, make me, make me wanna cry
 And now I beg to see you dance just one more time
 So they say
 Dance for me, dance for me, dance for me, oh, oh, oh
 I've never seen anybody do the things you do before
 They say move for me, move for me, move for me, ay, ay, ay
 And when you're done I'll make you do it all again
 They say
 Dance for me, dance for me, dance for me, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
 I've never seen anybody do the things you do before
 They say move for me, move for me, move for me, ay, ay, ay
 And when you're done I'll make you do it all again
 Ooh
 Woah-oh, woah-oh, oh
 Ooh
 Ah ah, ah
 They say
 Dance for me, dance for me, dance for me, oh, oh, oh
 I've never seen anybody do the things you do before
 They say move for me, move for me, move for me, ay, ay, ay
 And when you're done I'll make you do it all again
 They say
 Dance for me, dance for me, dance for me, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
 I've never seen anybody do the things you do before
 They say move for me, move for me, move for me, ay, ay, ay
 And when you're done I'll make you do it all again
 All again
